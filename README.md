# Daily Task Manager (Prototype)

**Daily Task Manager** is an early-stage Android prototype app designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks efficiently. This project serves as a foundational version with core task management features, intended to evolve into a full-fledged, personalized productivity app available on the Google Play Store.

## Overview

This app helps users create, view, and manage daily tasks in a simple, intuitive interface. Currently, it functions as a basic task organizer, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

The long-term goal is to implement user-specific task management with Firebase integration, enabling:

- Secure user authentication
- Real-time syncing of tasks across devices
- Personalized task lists for each user
- Notifications and reminders
- Offline access and data caching
